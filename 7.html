<!--
½ page summary that generally explains the “need to know” of your cult
 -->
 <p>
The Heaven's Gate Cult was a group of people who believed that they were higher-level beings in the bodies (containers or vehicles, they thought) of humans temporarily. Applewhite, a leader, thought that he was the new version of Jesus. When the Hale-Bopp comet was discovered, they believed that there was a spaceship hiding behind it that was going to take them back to their higher-level self. When the comet was it's closest to Earth, the members killed themselves wearing matching clothing with a mixture of vodka and drugs. The cult was not actively violent to anyone outside of the cult, but they did try to recruit members. The cult also had a web design company, and two members are remaining running the cult's website. They say that there isn't a group to join anymore, though, they just want the information to be avaliable to those who want to learn.

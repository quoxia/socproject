      <h2>Beliefs and Values</h2>
<!--
What are the basic principles of the Cult: Beliefs and values – religious affiliations – location and living styles – etc., sworn oaths of allegiance? Daily activities?
	-You should be fairly detailed on this slide! Examples, details, elaboration, etc
 -->
 <ul>
   <li>Nettles had a lot of knowledge of the Bible, and thought that she and Applewhite were the "chosen two" from the Book of Revelation.</li>
   <li>The two, personally, thought that their "calling" meant that they didn't have to follow laws...</li>
   <li>They thought that their bodies were just containers or vehicles for holy beings to live in for a while.</li>
   <li>There were strange diets that members were required to follow sometimes.</li>
   <li>Other activites, like sex and smoking and drinking, were forbidden.</li>
   <li>Members were required to wear baggy clothing and keep short hair.</li>
   <li>Applewhite thought that the Hale-Bopp Comet was a sign of a spaceship coming to get them and take them to the "Next Level."</li>
   <li>When the comet came closest to Earth, the members of the cult killed themselves by drinking a mixture of vodka and some lethal drugs.</li>

      <h2>Why Would People Join?</h2>
      <h4>(my opinion)</h4>
<!--
State your personal opinion as to why people joined this specific cult
a.	Your chance here to judge/evaluate/analyze

 <ul>
   <li>I think people could have joined because they wanted to have some sort of purpose.</li>
   <li>The leaders advertised knowing what the point of life was and what came after, which could have been very appealing for many.</li>
   <li>I will also be the first to admit, I think that their website looks nice.</li>

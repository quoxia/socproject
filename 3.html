 <ul>
   <li>Despite what one may expect, many of the people in the cult were just normal people</li>
   <li>Nettles and Applewhite would advertise their cult, and people who were curious would look into it for a chance to learn the meaning of life</li>
   <li>Preaching the knowledge of what happens after death and the meaning of life is a surefire way to gain followers, and that is just what Nettles and Applewhite did.</li>

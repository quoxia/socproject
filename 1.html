      <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <!-- Include important background information â€“ who founded the cult, how they grew up, what kind of kid they were, did they suffer any traumatic events?  Were they abused?  Were they mistreated? How did they come to form their own cult -->
        <ul>
          <li>Leaders: Bonnie Lu Nettles (AKA "Ti") and Marshall Applewhite (AKA "Do")</li>
          <li>Applewhite almost died and Nettles was his nurse in 1972. Nettles convinced Applewhite to join her in her beliefs.</li>
          <li>Applewhite went on after Nettles' death to lead the cult.</li>
          <li>Applewhite was born in Spur, Texas on May 17, 1931.</li>
          <li>He led a normal life before his near-death experience.</li>
          <li>Two years before he met Nettles, he divorced a woman with whom he had two children, and there were rumors that he had trouble with his sexual identity. This caused stress in his life. </li>
          <li>As stated, the two met in the hospital and it all spiraled from there.</li>
